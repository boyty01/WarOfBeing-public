Early template for War of Being's gameplay system that includes support for epics Gameplay Ability System.  

The VR module has dependency on the VRExpansion plugin by Joshua (MordenTral) Statzer and should be disabled if not installed/required to successfully build the source code. 

VR module includes transcoded logic for the gripping system from MordenTral's blueprint example into native C++, including grips, sockets and climbing logic.  Some customisations have been made to more closely fit the projects purposes and iron out some smooth movement issues.
